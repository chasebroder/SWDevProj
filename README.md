# SWDevProj



### Notes for things to improve from before:


* Clean up client and server, try to get more than two clients to connect successfully

* Check serializer for correctness


* we should test the df.filter method also implement it

* Consider:are the strings provided in A4P1 immutable? - probably should be for this project
^^ Do we really need to clone?


* Consider:Row allowed to copy the data?

* document which methods using String\* take ownership and makes copies in comments

* Change all NULL references to nullptr

* Rename float references to double

* Remove all column name references

* Do we need both ColumnArray and ColArr?

* Fix old tests to compile/run/pass
