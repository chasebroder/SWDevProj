# SWDevProj



### Notes for things to improve from before:

* Clean up client and server, try to get more than two clients to connect successfully

* Check serializer for correctness

* rewrite lengthrower to use fielder (fielder takes idx and row ref)

*we should test the df.filter method also implement it

* Consider:are the strings provided in A4P1 immutable? - probably should be for this project
^^ Do we really need to clone?

*accept could call start/finish on fielder

*Consider:Row allowed to copy the data?

*document which methods using String\* take ownership and makes copies in comments
